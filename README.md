### Hey guys!
#### I'm Aroldo Santos, web developer.


I really like working with the web, especially with the PHP language and the Laravel framework. But I also apply Javascript and Python to a lesser extent.

As you can see, I cleaned up my Github. But in the weeks ahead we'll be back to having fun with code, whether to practice or to create. Until then!
